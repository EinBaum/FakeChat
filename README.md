#FakeChat

###Features

This Addon can add chat messages to your chat that look like they are real messages.

- Make it look like you are whispering someone (they will not receive the message even if online)
- Make a fake person whisper you with pre-programmed messages when pressing a hotkey
- Designed with video recording in mind; key bindings are used to send the messages

###Usage

- Type /fc or /fakechat into the chat to open the menu
- Enter the fake player name into the "Name" field
- Check the "Is Gamemaster" checkbox if the fake player should have a GM tag
- Add messages that the fake player should send
- Click "Key Bindings" and scroll down to "FakeChat" to define the key bindings that trigger the chat messages
- Use the "Send Message" hotkey to send one fake message
- Press "Back To First" or the appropriate hotkey to go back to the first message in the list
- You can whisper the fake player. The messages that you send will not arrive even if the real player is online
